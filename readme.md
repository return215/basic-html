# Basic HTML/CSS/JS(TS) Project

This is a basic create-a-page project using vanilla HTML and CSS.
This project uses TypeScript that will later be compiled to JavaScript.

To compile `*.ts` code in `src/` folder, run this in the command line
(assuming you already have `node` and `npm` installed).

```sh
# run this the first time only
npm install
npm run build
```
